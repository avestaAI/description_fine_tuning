The beautiful Johnstone River hardwood floors were resanded and polished and have come up beautifully. They will probably last another 40 years. The main bathroom is modern and bright with its large walk-in shower. The deck off the kitchen/ dining area is undercover and commands excellent views towards Coquette Point and over the pool. This is the perfect place for entertaining or a quiet breakfast. I think you would probably enjoy all of your meals out here.\n\nThe bedrooms are all a good size, there is air conditioning throughout and there is even a self-contained guest bedroom with its bathroom and kitchenette downstairs. Also downstairs is a very large double garage space, with double depth and a huge workshop space attached. This is also where you find the pool deck and the built-in BBQ area, along with the large pool and even an additional shed out the back. \n\nThe house has had plenty of money spent on it with lots of new fans and light fittings, some upgraded air conditioners, and some fresh paint. There is not a cent to spend on it now. It is a combination of the generous proportions of the 80s along with the modern and stylish trends of today.\n\nThis is a wonderful family home.\n\nContact Michael Skuse",
