A tranquil escape to your own private paradise, it is perfectly designed for rest and relaxation, a place where family and friends can come together.  \n\nAs you step inside the entry arbor gate, a lush tropical front garden welcomes you.  Beautifully landscaped with timber walkways, stepping-stone pavers and spots to stop, sit and admire your private gardens, prepare to fall in love before you even enter this magical home.\n\nStepping through the blue front door, you are greeted by soaring cathedral ceilings and an ingenious use of glass that captures the tranquil bushland views, casting an open, airy ambience throughout the home. Here, an unparalleled sense of space takes shape, owing to the open warehouse-style layout, ultra-chic feel and resort-style ambience. \n\nAn expansive and continuous living, dining and kitchen space fills the main level of the home, creating the perfect atmosphere for intimate home life and entertaining the largest of crowds. A striking feature wall, crafted by a talented German master painter, stretches from floor to ceiling, adding impact to the space.  A stunning combustion fireplace is a more recent addition, keeping the home warm in the winter months.  \n\nThe entire main level flows seamlessly out to the generously sized decks. Wrapping around the home, the decks provide the perfect vantage point to soak in the sights and sounds of Australia's iconic bushland. Cafe blinds allow the space to be fully open or sectioned off to create a cosy sunroom. \n\nThe entry mezzanine level flows either side to all three bedrooms, with a separate study. Step up a split level to discover your private master retreat, complete with a full wall of built-ins and a stunning, renovated ensuite with black soaker tub.  Your private deck provides the ideal spot to unwind and soak in the bushland views.\n\nThe home features a total of two beautifully renovated bathrooms (two soaker tubs!)  plus a powder room and third toilet room.\n\nA modern, vibrant kitchen sets the scene for culinary exploration!  It is sure to inspire even the most amateur of cooks with its fun, colourful bursts in the cabinetry and, if colour is not your thing, the cabinets can easily be sprayed. The superbly appointed kitchen offers a full range of quality appliances including two gas ovens, dishwasher, double gas cooktop, and large walk-in pantry.\nOutdoors, you can seek rest and relaxation on the expansive decks or enjoy a dip in the pool/spa. Relax poolside in the new gazebo or perch at the bar area with a drink.  \n\nYour fully-fenced, bushland backyard has been neatly landscaped with an array of plants and fruit trees.  A chicken coup is a bonus (or handy extra storage area).\nRest easy, knowing your vehicles are safe and secure in the double lock-up garage complete with electric garage door and additional storage areas. \n\nOther quality features include:\nSolar heart gas water, Solar panels (7 kw), quality built-in cabinetry in the main living zone, new ceiling fans and blinds throughout the home, security screens, new outdoor spotlights, front driveway has been re-sealed and re-painted.\n\nDiscover the convenience of living in such a prime position within minutes to the Logan Hyperdome, cafes, restaurants, public transport and easy access to the M1 leading to the Gold Coast and Brisbane CBD.
