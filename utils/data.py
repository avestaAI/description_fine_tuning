A sunken facade that is hidden away from the street makes this deceptively-spacious 4 bedroom 2 bathroom home all the more enchanting, with plenty of charm, character and an impressively-extended floor plan providing you and your family with the perfect relaxed lifestyle, beyond the most unassuming of first impressions. 

A tranquil and sought-after location is simply an added bonus here, with the residence nestled within easy walking distance of both the South Trigg and Scarborough Beaches, as well as some of Western Australia's finest surfing spots. The property also sits on a comfortable 520sqm (approx.) survey-strata block, ensuring heaps of indoor and outdoor space for all involved.

A paved courtyard entrance is out of sight from the road and can also be accessed via double doors from a spacious front master-bedroom suite - ceiling fan, separate full-height "his and hers" built-in wardrobes, retro-tiled ensuite, bathtub, showerhead, twin vanities, under-bench storage, two-way powder-room access and all. The powder room also has matching floor tiles, keeping in theme.

Also at the front of the house is a large second bedroom with a ceiling fan and full-height built-in robes of its own. The central lounge room is well-equipped to tackle both the summer heat and the winter cold with its ceiling fan, gas bayonet and a split-system air-conditioning unit. It also seamlessly opens outdoors to a large side courtyard with four shade sails up above, helping protect everybody from the elements.

The living space connects to an open-plan dining, sitting and kitchen area where high raked ceilings, another fan and gas bayonet and a breakfast bar complement separate external access to the courtyard. The tiled kitchen itself has an adjacent study or meals nook where there is more than enough space for either a computer desk or snack table, adjacent to double sinks, tiled splashbacks, a stainless-steel Blanco range hood, a stainless-steel five-burner Blanco gas cooktop and electric oven and a matching stainless-steel Asko dishwasher.

The back of the floor plan is where you will find a decent third bedroom with a ceiling fan, a lovely leafy outlook to wake up to and triple-sliding-door floor-to-wall-to-ceiling built-in robes, a separate fourth bedroom with a fan and a fully-tiled and modern laundry-come-main bathroom - complete with square feature wall tiles, stylish hexagonal floor tiles, a walk-in rain/hose shower, a sleek stone vanity and a toilet.

At the rear, a separate patio-entertaining deck provides another option that will keep your guest happy and splendidly overlooks a shaded tree-lined backyard with lawn, a drying courtyard with a clothesline and a large garden shed in the corner. Throw into the mix those sensual sea breezes and fabulous cross-flow ventilation once some of the doors are kept open during those warmer months and you have yourself quite the pleasurable living experience.

The kids can walk to Deanmore Primary School and a plethora of lush local parklands around the corner from the front door, with bus stops, majestic natural bushland, community sporting facilities at the stunning Abbett Park facility and sunset drinks at the Scarborough esplanade all only a matter of footsteps away themselves.

The kitchen was recently replaced and would have cost a pretty penny with its composite benchtops, massive drawer storage, and stainless steel appliances.

The main bathroom is modern and bright with its large walk-in shower. The deck off the kitchen/ dining area is undercover and commands excellent views towards Coquette Point and over the pool. This is the perfect place for entertaining or a quiet breakfast. I think you would probably enjoy all of your meals out here.

The bedrooms are all a good size, there is air conditioning throughout and there is even a self-contained guest bedroom with its bathroom and kitchenette downstairs. Also downstairs is a very large double garage space, with double depth and a huge workshop space attached. This is also where you find the pool deck and the built-in BBQ area, along with the large pool and even an additional shed out the back. 

The house has had plenty of money spent on it with lots of new fans and light fittings, some upgraded air conditioners, and some fresh paint. There is not a cent to spend on it now. It is a combination of the generous proportions of the 80s along with the modern and stylish trends of today.

This is a wonderful family home.

"As the owners of this beautiful home, we can confidently say that this is a home for a growing family.
We love the flexibility that the two living areas provide. When the kids were little they were able to be loud and chaotic in a space that we knew was safe and where we could check on them without being too bothered, when they got older we were able to use the spaces to entertain or just relax in two separate spaces. The master bedroom is quite large and the ensuite added to the convenience in the home, limiting how many people needed to share the main bathroom.
Our kids have loved playing in the huge backyard while we have enjoyed spending time on the covered deck. It is such a peaceful space to spend time in, especially in the warmer months, hosting friends and family on the deck. 
Lastly, we have to mention the friendly neighbourhood. Located within walking distance to the Amaroo shopping precinct and both public & private schools, it's the perfect location.
We have made everlasting memories living here and I know you will too."

The stone-topped kitchen matches function and form, offering a wide Falcon stove and a Miele dishwasher among endless storage including a walk-in pantry.



The accommodation places each room independently with ever-generous proportions, including two bedrooms on the ground floor. Upstairs, a central retreat provides space for the family to unwind in the glow of a gas fireplace, segregating two further bedrooms including a lavish master bedroom with wall-to-wall fitted robes and an ensuite. 



Finished with a family bathroom, a guest powder room, a large laundry, plus a double garage with 15A power, the home cossets the family in the comforts of ducted heating, evaporative cooling, split system air-conditioning, a security alarm and CCTV, and a 5,

Situated in Wattle Flat, 'Cotty Creek Cottage' is about 10 minutes from Creswick,
        20 minutes from Ballarat and 1.5 hours from Melbourne via the western freeway.

Where do I startFirstly its a really comfortable, three bedroom plus study, split level home on a very private 5.4 ha ( 13 acre ) site.

We all want to put our own stamp on our homes, but with this one, any changes would only be by choice. Literally, you could move in and just put the kettle on. Its tasteful, characterful and warm, with a centrally located wood burner and a split system for summer cooling.
The large, open plan kitchen, dining, living room, with a double height ceiling and exposed trusses, faces north letting the sunlight stream inside. The kids bedrooms, study and sunroom are downstairs and a large parents retreat upstairs. All around are views to the surrounding forest and paddocks.

Ajoining the Creswick Regional Park, you can sit on the verandah and watch the parade of wildlife.

There are several paddocks for your animals and large shed, re-purposed as a barn with stable area and yard.

So much going on here!

An orchard of fruit trees (fenced and netted), chicken coup, an irrigated veggie garden with greenhouse and potting shed, two dams and a seasonal creek with waterfall. There are an additional two large sheds, each with a concrete floor and power, plus a double carport. All the hard work has been done for you.

Its also got the biggest pine tree Ive ever seen, which is listed for its regional significance. A large mature wood lot should keep you in firewood for the foreseeable future.

The property is completely off grid with a fully functioning solar power system plus additional micro hydro turbine, and gas-boosted solar hot water. Three water tanks offering over 80,
        000L for for domestic water. The dam supplies water to the gardens and stock troughs.
All the tech specs are available, for now just be aware that its well maintained, relatively new and works for a family of four.

There is also a very sophisticated bushfire safety system including a purpose-built bunker.

We are asked often for properties like this, weekenders, tree changes or permanent homes out of town.
Not often do you find something as complete as this, where you can kick back and enjoy the serenity, or get busy in the shed or the garden, its your happy place in the country.

Inspections on advertised times or by appointment.

A note from the seller: 

We absolutely love our home and it's been one of the best decisions we have ever made to move here. When we decided to move from our acreage home, we were nervous we would lose the privacy and peacefulness that we love about the Samford area. This home captured our hearts though. This location not only gave us the convenience we wanted for our high school aged children but also the serene, private atmosphere that we were longing for. Our outdoor entertaining area and pool has become our cherished sanctuary and we spend hours there. The other thing we love about our home is that there are so many great spaces to either connect or get away when you want to, which is perfect for our family of five.

This family orientated suburb offers a peaceful daily life whilst providing good access to the hustle and bustle of the city when desired.

Metropolitan stands out. It is the essence of Melbourne. At home in the Paris end of our most famous boulevard, it has been crafted to give residents the iconic Melbourne lifestyle experience.  It has been designed to create a point of difference amongst the classical symmetry of the existing streetscape, with  bold, modern lines creating a dynamic form, emphasised by the irregular patterning of the stunning floor to ceiling windows.

Gaze out your window, across the city skyline and it is immediately apparent that all manner of amenity is at your fingertips. An entire city for you to explore. At Metropolitan, the communal rooftop deck and dining room acts as a private sanctuary for residents to relax with friends and family and enjoy sweeping views across our stunning city.

Inside the apartments, the contrasting black and white colour palette continues, creating a bold, modern look. It is offset by the warm tones of the floorboards and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that allow natural light to fill the space. The kitchens at Metropolitan are sleek and minimalist, designed to maximise space and functionality. Integrated appliances provide supreme  convenience, while the brilliant, reflective surface of the joinery is a beautiful counterpoint to the unique matt black tap ware and lighting. In the bathroom the matt black fixtures are dramatic accents against the pristine white wall tiles, culminating in a contemporary, considered design that is ideal for city life.

Please note the study in this one bedroom apartment is big enough to put a single bed if you have visiting friend. Quality furniture and electrical appliances will make it a cosy home. Inspection can be booked online, but please be quick!

Completed homes on similar land parcels have recently achieved from $1.1m - $1.65m in the past 12 months (Core Logic). 

Our favourite features of this rare-sized block are its wildlife corridor outlook, north facing backyard and generous envelope to accommodate the design of the ultimate forever home.

The land is registered and ready to build on.

Ideally located in Teralba - this Lake Macquarie suburb has risen 125% in 5 years and just claimed a spot on NSW's Top 10 Boom Suburbs; in fact it was number 3, right after perennial seachange favourite Kingscliff. Buyers love that unlike other emerging new estates, it is still close to all the action of the water and cafes (2.5km).

Location: 5min to Speers Point,
        10min to Warners Bay or the Freeway,
        15min to Charlestown,
        25min to Newcastle or John Hunter Hospital.

Lifestyle: Walk to coffee in the morning at Maddz on York in quaint Teralba Village (1km), cycle around Lake Macquarie or sunset drinks at Pippis. Weekends you will love the waterfront Speers Point Farmers Market or brunching at Warners Bay. 5min to local Coles and Woolworths,
        15min to Kotara Westfields,
        20min to Redhead Beach and 40min to the Hunter Valley. """
